This Java-based Online Reservation System is designed to streamline the process of booking and managing train tickets. The system is divided into three main modules:
Login Form:
Users need to have a valid login ID and password to access the system.
The login form ensures that only authorized users can enter the main system, maintaining the security of the data.
Reservation System:

n this module, users fill out a reservation form with their personal details, train number, and other necessary information.
The system automatically populates the train name based on the train number entered.
Users can choose their class type, specify the date of their journey, and select the departure and destination locations.
Once all details are filled out, users simply press the insert button to complete their reservation.
Cancellation Form:
If a user needs to cancel a reservation, they can do so by entering their PNR number into the cancellation form.
After submitting the PNR number, the system will display all relevant information associated with that particular reservation, allowing users to confirm and process the cancellation.
